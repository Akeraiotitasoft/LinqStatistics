In order to write unit tests they should be hand verified and hand coded
So some of the percentiles are calculated where it makes sense and some are skipped logically.

For the InversePercentileTests:

Given this list of elements:
1
10
2
99
-10
1000
55
5
7
(total 9 elements)

Sort them:
-10
1
2
5
7
10
55
99
1000
(total 9 elements sorted)

0.0013 * 9 = 0.0117
Floor it
0
zero based index at 0 is -10

0.0228 * 9 = 0.2052
Floor it
0
zero based index at 0 is -10

0.1587 * 9 = 1.4283
Floor it
1
zero based index at 1 is 1

0.5 * 9 = 4.5
Floor it
4
zero based index at 4 is 7

0.75 * 9 = 6.75
Floor it
6
zero based index at 6 is 55

0.8413 * 9 = 7.5717
Floor it
7
zero based index at 7 is 99

0.90 * 9 = 8.1
Floor it
8
zero based index at 8 is 1000

For the StandardDeviationTests and SampleStandardDeviationTests:

Used calculator soup to calculate the standard deviation
